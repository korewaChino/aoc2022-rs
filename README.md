# Cappy's Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

I admit some of these aren't very inefficient, but I want a solution that is easy to understand and modify, not necessarily the most efficient.

Sometimes, clean code is more important than fast code.
